# 2/13/17 Notes

<b> GUI runs! </b>

EVERYONE'S code is all combined now in the master branch. I had to add some methods/variables to make sure everything works.
There are still some errors still but we can fix that of course. If you want to run the app, just comment out all the errors and it'll work.

Hopefully the Client side is good, and we just need to work on the server and check connectivity. Once we have the connectivity good, then we can just simply do the game lobby and start game button on the GUI. 

<b> NOTE: </b> In the LoginFragment, the server address and server port aren't implemented. It's just fields to enter text. Still need to implement an error Toast when the username/password fields are empty.
